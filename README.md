# Machine-learning-parameter-tuning-for-Bidirectional-LSTM
 Bidirectional LSTM for accurate taxi travel time prediction, addressing urban transportation issues. The dataset is preprocessed for quality, with 75% for training and 25% for testing. Parameter tuning is applied to the hidden layer, dropout rate, and optimizers (Adam, SGD).
